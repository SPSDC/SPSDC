# SPSDC
SharePoint Saturday DC Events have been taking place in the DC metro area in association with SPS Events since 2010. The events have primarily been held at Microsoft's Reston and Chevy Chase offices.

Typically the Spring / Summer event will be held in either May or June at the Chevy Chase, MD Microsoft office and the Fall / Winter event at the Reston, VA Microsoft office.

Our events are wholly put together by volunteers and paid for by sponsors that seek to continue to foster the SharePoint community in the DC meto area.

If you're interested in getting involved with the coordination and organization of events or sponsoring an event, please let the organizing committee know by sending an e-mail to <mailto:spsdc@spsdc.org>.
